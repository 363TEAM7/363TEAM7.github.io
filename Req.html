          <h1>Purpose and Goals</h1>
          <p class="disp"> 
KFUPM Library System is basically updating the manual library system into an
internet-based website so that the users can know the details of their accounts, availability of
books.<br>
<br>
The project is specifically designed for the use of librarians and library users. The product will
work as a complete user interface for library management process and library usage from
ordinary users. Library Management System can be used by any existing or new library to
manage its books and book borrowing, insertion and monitoring. It is especially useful for any
educational institute where modifications in the content can be done easily according to
requirements.<br>
<br>
The project can be  implemented under various situations. The language used for developing the project
 is HTML as it is quite advantageous than other languages in terms of performance, tools available, cross
 platform compatibility, libraries, cost
, and development process.
